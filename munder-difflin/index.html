                <br>
                <p>What we really want to do is reaffirm the desire to use paper. Paper isn’t trying to take down pixels. Paper is about 2,000 years old, born in China. It instantly became vital and has stayed so, perhaps more than any other substance on Earth, excluding water. Paper has gotten a bad rap. Paper is wonderful. We love the stuff.</p>
                <br>

                <p>
                    We thinks it's okay with some of paper’s functions being replaced by machines, particularly if a few trees are saved in the process. Paper has been known to work with technology — the first computers used paper punch cards.
                </p>

                <p><b>Famous Jim line: We can’t say whether Dunder-Mifflin paper is less flammable. But we can assure you that it is certainly not more flammable.”</b></p>

                <h2 id="use-paper-creatively">Use Paper Creatively!</h2>
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Paper can be used in many ways. Folding, writing, recycling, building, these are just some ideas for using paper. Finding a creative use is great for when you're bored or you have a particularly special piece of paper you want to do something with. Origami is the Japanese art of paper folding, and with it you can make an enormous range of things out of a simple sheet of paper. You can make paper cranes, butterflies, "fox-puppets", and much more.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Do paper mache and combine torn strips of paper or newspaper with a sticky substance like glue or wallpaper paste and apply it to an object or mold it into shapes. Start drawing! Grab a pencil or some colored pens and just start doodling! Express yourself and draw whatever inspires you. You could try drawing less realistic things like cartoons and manga, or perhaps draw something in the room or a friend or family member. A really nice way to use the paper would be to go outside and just draw what you see. </p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <p>Paper packaging is the largest sector, accounting for around 65% of all recycled packaging. Paper and paperboard also have the highest recycling rates worldwide (with the exception of glass in some countries). Demand for paper packaging will continue to grow, due to the manufacturing economies of China and other emerging countries.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Recovered paper accounts for 37% of the US pulp supply. The demand for paper pulp is growing rapidly in developing countries; China, India and the rest of Asia are the fastest growing users of paper per capita. The increase in the transit packaging sector in China, combined with growing consumerism, is leading to rapidly growing demand for paper packaging. Paper packaging demand has been growing at a rate of 6.5% since 2008, far higher than anywhere else in the world.</p>

                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>When you throw out your paper, you’ll be throwing away examples of painstaking research. Crumple, uncrumple, crumple. Sheet after sheet landed in the recycling bin, each one blank but for its chaotically creased geography. In time, a semblance of order emerged.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The dynamics of crumpling are in play everywhere: in the initial unfolding of an insect’s wing; in the way DNA packs into a cell nucleus, in the challenge of how best to cram a giant solar sail into a small satellite so that it unfurls successfully. Scientists, in turn, devote considerable energy to deciphering, and trying to reduce, this complexity and disorder. Paper is an ideal model.</p>
